# Note Taker Guide

## Agenda Creation

Take down proposed topics pairwise and note:

 - Number
 - Session title
 - Abstract
 - convenor(s)

Enter it into the Session Manager app:

https://tiime.sessiontracker.eu/sessions/eventsessions/2

## Session

At the beginning

- ask convenors to verify the abstract
- ask the participants to help with note taking (a few more eyes help when talks are fast or difficult to capture)
- ask if anyone needs help with the Attendee App

When 5 minutes are left to the end of the session:

- ask the group to wrap up and
- nominate a rappoteur for the summary session

Post scriptum

When the session is over and people are moving to the next session or into the break,
try to get hold of people and ask them to clarify points you missed, or ask 
them to update contents /before/ the summary session.

Also review what you have written as soon as time is available, and your memory is still fresh.
