    <p><strong>Trust by SNCTFI (David Kelsey)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Aspects</strong> :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data protection?</li>
  <li>What ideas do we have to how we assert compliance with this policy?</li>
  <li>Won´t want metadata. Maybe we need some trust mark (self-assertion, Peer-review, how do we assert/register/publish it</li>
</ul>

<p>Data protection</p>

<ul>
  <li>–Code of Conduct (CoCo)-session from yesterday</li>
  <li>–May 2018</li>
  <li>–Scope of the CoCo was about attributes from the SP enabling access.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Proposal</strong> :</p>

<p>If it is possible to expand the CoCo so it includes these aspects.</p>

<p>A lot of the entities are not exposed into the federation. Why not include the other AA into the CoCo.</p>

<p>There is a monitoring entity which controls if one entity is in the CoCo.</p>

<p>The initial approach was that do only something if someone complains.</p>

<p>Does it have to be pro-active?</p>

<p>If you are serving services to European citizen, then CoCo applies.</p>

<p><strong>Assumption about SNCTFI</strong> : With the CoCo approach there needs to be an extension. There are some processes and outcomes needed to come to an understanding. SNCTFI does something about that.</p>

<p>If you subscribe to CoCo, you can do legally everything it allows.</p>

<p>If you process data from Europe or a citizen who is in Europe in the US you have to subscribe to CoCo. Are there any conflicts to CoCo in Illinois?</p>

<p><strong>Is it worth to have the discussion about CoCo for SNCTFI?</strong></p>

<p>We are not writing something down to exclude some of the federation.</p>

<p>Both parts of CoCo apply to the proxies. If you got Attributes from another Authority you have to process them in another way.</p>

<p><strong>Do we need an agreement for CoCo from ever SP-proxy?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, we have a procedure to follow. The proxy can never sign a CoCo if some requirements aren´t met?</p>

<p>We need more discussion with the CoCo-people. It would be good to have this use-case covered.</p>

<p><strong>How to do (self-) assessment, and where do we advertise the fact that we got this?</strong></p>

<p>We mean Assessment of SNCTFI. How does the proxy or the research infrastructure know, that every proxy runs with SNCTFI?</p>

<p><strong>If you hide the fact that you are a proxy in CoCo you are fine?</strong></p>

<p>One of the things we did was to say that we don´t trust proxies. We don´t do that anymore.</p>

<p>If you are an R&amp;S it is the easiest way to get attributes.</p>

<p><strong>Entity-Category</strong></p>

<p>Do R&amp;S and if there is CoCo too, then that too.</p>

<p>They want to have a service level agreement that the others don´t have.</p>

<p><strong>Part of the solution is to add more categories?</strong></p>

<p>I don´t think that adding another category is a good idea.</p>

<p>Categories confuse the IdPs. I rather see another wrap of R&amp;S that says "if you are a proxy than go over for SNCTFI and then come back"</p>

<p><strong>The entity-tags are not the issue, but they are not flowing?</strong></p>

<p>For now we are not rushing for another category. Some advantages, but we need to discuss it further.</p>

<p>We would go with self-asserted compliance. Do we know start to think about where we also can register?</p>

<p><strong>What research-infrastructure do we suspect??</strong> Many.</p>

<p>Deploy a proxy for 65 people. They all have the R&amp;S-tag. I think you have to consider the much smaller groups. It is spread across 3 different countries. I don´t want it just to be for LIGO.</p>

<p>Interesting question how to peer-review small ones.</p>

<p>Participating in a peer-review process is very time-expensive (including travel-costs).</p>

<p>Maybe there is a larger community who wants to peer-review for them. Maybe an SP would be agreeing to make more peer-reviews.</p>

<p>Reviews are to certify trust-marks.</p>

<p>For Phase 1 we should just do the self-assignment.</p>

<p>SNCFTI-Document will look like a certifying document.</p>

<p>As an organization I would not say we use CoCo if I'd not know if everyone applies it.</p>

<p>Agreeing: Self assumption, pubic webpage.</p>

<p>SP are running by research-infrastructures.</p>

<p>There is much work about protecting attributes and what people do with them. We need to be sure about trust. Why is there so much protection?</p>

<p>Certifying is unrelated to the attributes (part of SNCTFI). R&amp;S = we tag an SP so we do not send to SPs we don´t want to.</p>

<p>David will summarize this session at the summary session.</p>
