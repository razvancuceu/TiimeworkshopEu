There are services which state they are free, but "if you are not paying for something, then you are the product".
Then there are services, which have premium setting, where you are just not seeing ads but that most likely sell your data anyway.
And then there are services where you pay, and your data is sold and someone else who is profiled similar to you is seeing the ads.
