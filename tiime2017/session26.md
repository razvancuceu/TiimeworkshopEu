**Good examples of usage of personal data (Berit Skjernaa)**

There are a lot of bad examples where things went really wrong, good to talk about the upsides too.

Anonymizing data does not actually make the person behind it not identifiable.

Data can also be encrypted in a way so results can still be calculated, but the actual data is not seen, which can be used in research.

**Taxonomy of Privacy**

Value to be gained from these large amounts of data, for example in terms of health.

Privacy is not about keeping data secret, it&#39;s about releasing it with control.

Assertion for one certain attribute without knowing anyone&#39;s identity is important. Whenever information is released, it should be down to the minimal.

Separation of different personal attributes of a person is also important, that certain information can be selectively released.

**Contextual Integrity**

Chilling effect of not being afraid to speak opinion online.

Identification tends to be misused, people think that your databases are anonymous.

The other means using large amounts of data, there are various types of encryption that don&#39;t really see the data and the calculations get done without seeing the data.

It is clear that you can identify someone from just data and not only from identifiers.

This is changing the way we think about it.

For example passports.

But this is not how the internet works.

There are solutions pseudonymous attribute based credentials (Microsoft u-prove , ABC4Trust ) but there are no good examples of anonymity.

Technology looking for a problem to be solved, the use cases are so contrived that they do not make sense. For example I want to prove you that I am 18 but I don&#39;t want to show you my banking card information , basically I need to hide 80% of my information just to showcase you my age .

**Age Verification Scheme:**

**Touch2ID** - For young people who want to go to pubs and have their proof of age. Touch to ID had an enrollment process you show up in person with prove of age and you enroll with giving a thumbprint, you are given a thumbprint, you put your thumb on the card, if the thumb matches then they know that you have gone through the enrolment process.
